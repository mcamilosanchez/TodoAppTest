# Todo List App - Clean Architecture

The **Todo List App** is an Android application built in Kotlin, featuring a modern design and intuitive interface using Jetpack Compose. This application is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently and effectively. It incorporates Clean Architecture principles combined with the MVVM pattern to ensure a well-structured, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a comprehensive solution for daily task tracking.
- **Local Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored locally using Room, ensuring data is securely saved and accessible even offline.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns, maintaining an organized code structure and facilitating long-term maintenance and scalability.
- **Intuitive UI**: Designed entirely with Jetpack Compose, delivering a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Hilt for streamlined dependency management, promoting modularity and reducing boilerplate code.

## Technologies and Architecture

- **Language**: Developed in Kotlin, leveraging its concise syntax and robust feature set.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Ensures a declarative, highly customizable, and efficient UI development.
- **Room Database**: Provides secure and reliable local storage for task data.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Combines with Clean Architecture to separate UI logic, data handling, and domain logic for enhanced maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt simplifies dependency management, enhancing scalability and modularity.
